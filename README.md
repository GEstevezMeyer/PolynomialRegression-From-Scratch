# Polynomial Regression From Scratch 🧠  

This is my second machine learning project, where I build a **polynomial regression model** from scratch! The main goals are:  

✅ Understanding the **mathematics** behind it  
✅ **Optimizing** the code for better execution time  
✅ Making the model **work for any degree** \( n \), not just a fixed one  

My first implementation worked fine but wasn’t **optimized**. Using **Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM)** isn’t always the best choice for every model. In this project, we’ll explore **faster** and **more efficient** optimization methods!  

## 🛠️ Libraries Used  
- **pandas** – for data manipulation  
- **numpy** – for numerical operations  
- **matplotlib** – for visualization
